I am a software developer at [CoverMyMeds](https://www.covermymeds.com), where I write code to help pharmacists spend less time thinking about prior authorizations.

Previously, I worked at Chase doing data visualization and at Epic on the server systems team.

I have a Ph.D. in Physics from Ohio State for work on [The Influence of DNA Sequence and Post Translational Modifications on Nucleosome Positioning and Stability](https://etd.ohiolink.edu/pg_10?0::NO:10:P10_ACCESSION_NUM:osu1354733493).
